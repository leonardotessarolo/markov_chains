# markov_chains

Two main implementations are made: one regarding Variable-length Markov Chains (VLMC), also regarded as Context Trees, and another regarding Hidden Markov Models (HMM). 

### Variable-length Markov Chains

Folder vlmc/ contains source code for inference of VLMC processes. Three algorithms are implemented:
 - BIC: model estimation via minimization of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), in recursive algorithm as proposed in reference [1].
 - BCT: Bayesian Context Tree algorithm, estimation of maximum a posteriori model via recursive algorithm as proposed in reference [2].
 - Context: non-exact implementation of procedure described in reference [3].

Notebook 1-VLMC_examples.ipynb applies implemented algorithms for a set of toy examples.

### Hidden Markov Models

Folder hmm/ contains source code for inference on HMMs. Implementation follows forward and backward equations, Viterbi algorithm and expectation-maximization as described in reference [4]. Notebook 2-HMM_examples.ipynb applies implemented algorithm to toy examples.
